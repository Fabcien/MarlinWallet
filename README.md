# eCash Wallet

A super simple eCash Wallet application, focusing on UX and security.

At this stage it works on Android and IOS.

Run on Android:
`npm run android`

Run on IOS:
`npm run ios`

TODO:
 - [ ] Preload wallet data from the address while the mnemonic is loading for faster startup
 - [ ] Implement a watch-only mode as a fallback when the user don't authenticate
 - [ ] Make it a proper HD wallet with a new address for each transaction
