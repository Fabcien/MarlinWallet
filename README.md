# eCash Wallet

A super simple eCash Wallet application

At this stage it works on Android, the IOS files are all from the 
react-native default template.

TODO:
 - [ ] Use a configuration file instead of hardcoded parameters
 - [ ] Preload wallet data from the address while the mnemonic is loading for faster startup
 - [ ] Implement a watch-only mode as a fallback when the user don't authenticate
 - [ ] Make it a proper HD wallet with a new address for each transaction
